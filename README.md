### ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Welcome to my GitHub page!  

I'm an ambitious Master's student in Information Systems at the University of Cologne, currently in my second semester. Since mid-2023, I've been working as a software engineering working student, with a focus on frontend development using Vue.

Iâ€™m driven by a love for solving real problems with code and for continuously expanding my knowledge.
