### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a Master's student in Information Systems at the University of Cologne, currently in my third semester.  
Since July 2024, I've been working as a working student in software engineering, focusing on frontend development with Vue. In this role, I have also gained my first practical experience in backend development and am continuously expanding my skills toward full-stack development.  

Beyond coding, I really enjoy working with others to understand what's needed and why, and then turning those ideas into real, working solutions. I genuinely interested in the whole process of software engineering, from understanding requirements and the reason behind a project to actually building and improving it.
